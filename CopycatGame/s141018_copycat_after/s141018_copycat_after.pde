// THE COPYCAT GAME
// Version 1.0

// The copycat game is a creative coding exercice in which 
// two teams of two coders try to reproduce existing 
// animations based solely on the oral description given 
// by the other team. Each team picks a different gif and  
// has 5 minutes to describe it. The other team has 5 minutes 
// for questions. Each team then has 1 hour to code what
// they think is the best possible copy of the original.

// If you post your results online, please give credit 
// to the creator of the original.

// The copycat game was created at Creative Code Berlin
// and first played on September 20th 2014
