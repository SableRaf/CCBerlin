The Copycat Game
================

Version 1.0

The copycat game is a creative coding exercice in which two teams of two coders try to reproduce existing animations based solely on the oral description given by the other team. Each team picks a different gif and has 5 minutes to describe it. The other team has 5 minutes for questions. Each team then has 1 hour to code what they think is the best possible copy of the original.

If you post your results online, please give credit to the creator of the original.

The copycat game was created at Creative Code Berlin and first played on September 20th 2014
