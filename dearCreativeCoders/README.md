## Dear creative coders,

Our next Berlin meetup — the fifteenth Creative Coding Stammtisch — is coming up this Friday night at co.up. It is is a friendly gathering of artists, designers, students, academics, researchers and anyone interested in the use of technology as a medium. It’s a place to grow and share your passion for generative design, new media, net.art, etc. Everyone is welcome and free to present a project, propose a topic for discussion or even sit back and enjoy the conversation.

But we are not (only) writing to promote our event. The main reason we're putting this down is because up to now — we're ashamed to admit — our meetups have suffered from a gender bias not reflecting what we know to be the real diversity of the Art and Technology scene of Berlin. 

As members of Open Tech School as well as individually, our team has always been committed to supporting diversity. But it's not enough to be well-meaning and we've come to realize we need to be more vocal about what we stand for. We can do better and, from today on, we are going to.

We want people of any gender, origin, belief system, sexual orientation or knowledge level to feel welcome and supported. This is why we are reaching out to female artists/designers/theorists/students/learners to let you know that you DO belong and are part of it. We wish for a diversity of opinions to be represented and we will go out of our way to make the largest possible range of voices heard.

Wether you consider yourself to be a beginner or an expert, a theorist or a practicing artist/technologist, we invite you to join us on Friday, ask questions if you want, contribute with your comments and maybe show a project you're working on. Together, we can make our gatherings the diverse and supportive network it was always meant to be.


Ps: Though the main focus of this post is to address the gender bias, it goes without saying that our invitation extends to anyone who feels underrepresented in Art & Tech events.
