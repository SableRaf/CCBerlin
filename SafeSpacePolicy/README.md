Creative Code Berlin Safe Space Policy
======================================

Creative Code Berlin is dedicated to providing a harassment-free creative experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. Anyone violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the venue at the discretion of the organizers. 
 
Harassment includes verbal comments that reinforce social structures of domination related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, religion, sexual images, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of presentation or other activity, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. 
 
If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the venue. If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of staff immediately. 
 
Organizers will be happy to help participants contact security or local police, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the event. We value your attendance. 
 
**Exception:** Artwork, discussion, or content related to sex, pornography, discriminatory language, or similar can be presented on condition that it meets all of the following criteria: (a) the organizers have specifically granted permission in writing, (b) it is necessary to the topic of discussion and no alternative exists, (c) it is presented in a respectful manner, especially towards women and LGBTQIA people, (d) attendees are warned in advance and respectfully given ample warning and opportunity to leave beforehand. This exception specifically does not allow use of gratuitous sexual images as attention-getting devices or unnecessary examples. 
 
We expect participants to follow these rules at all our gatherings and associated social events. 

_This anti-harassment policy is based on the [example policy from the Geek Feminism wiki](http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Conference_anti-harassment/Policy), created by the Ada Initiative and other volunteers._
